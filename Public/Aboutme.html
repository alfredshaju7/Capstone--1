<p>Hey there! I'm Alfred Shaju, currently pursuing my BE in Computer Science with Business Systems at Chandigarh University. I'm an all-around tech enthusiast, and when I'm not diving deep into data structures or algorithms, you'll probably find me exploring the latest AI tools or working on some content writing projects. I'm really into creating video content, especially around driving experiences—cars and bikes are my jam, with a special love for the new Himalayan 450. 

    On the personal side, I'm a big fan of playing online multiplayer games like Ludo, especially with friends or my significant other. I have a pretty balanced lifestyle, waking up at 7:30 AM and hitting the bed around midnight, with a solid meal schedule in between. I'm passionate about fitness and working towards a more structured exercise routine. I also love experimenting with different recipes, especially those that align with my goal of achieving defined abs while meeting my protein needs. Chicken dishes are my absolute favorite!
    
    When I'm not busy with studies or hobbies, I enjoy delving into historical and religious topics, particularly Christianity's rich history in India. I love to stay active and continuously learn, always looking for new challenges and experiences.</p>
